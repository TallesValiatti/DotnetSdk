## How to Create an SDK in .NET

This repository provides a step-by-step guide on how to create an SDK in .NET to consume a Web API designed for food review sentiment analysis. The API leverages OpenAI models to assess the sentiment of food reviews, classifying them into one of five categories: **Very Good**, **Good**, **Medium**, **Bad**, or **Very Bad**.

Through this repository, you will learn not only how to create the SDK but also how to design a robust Web API in .NET. The API integrates OpenAI models for advanced sentiment analysis, offering a practical use case for AI-powered applications.

By following this guide, you'll gain valuable insights into building a reusable SDK that simplifies the integration of the sentiment analysis API into other .NET-based projects. This repository is an essential resource for developers seeking to enhance their applications with AI and streamline API consumption through a custom SDK.
